          <p class="titulo pt-4" style="margin-bottom: 0.6rem;">DIVE THE SUNKEN AIRPLANE</p>
          <p class="texto">If you’re looking for an excursion that’s anything but ordinary, be sure to dive the sunken World War II-era plane that sits in shallow water just off of Norman’s Cay. It makes for the perfect afternoon of exploration and adventure. Guests are invited to enjoy the submerged treasure, which is believed to have been a smuggler’s plane... that crashed in the 1980’s. The remains are shallow enough to snorkel, and scuba diving is an option for enthusiasts.</p>
          <p class="titulo" style="margin-bottom: 0.6rem;">DAY TRIP TO SHIP CHANNEL CAY</p>
          <p class="texto">Ship Channel Cay is the northernmost island in the Exumas, and for a short trip by boat, it’s a must-see for travelers seeking an extraordinary experience in the Bahamas. The island’s resident hog greets visitors (and occasionally attempts to steal drinks). Gentle nurse sharks and stingrays are known to inhabit the shallows. One of the smaller... cays in the Exumas, Ship Channel is a quaint place to stop for a drink, enjoy a ride on a catamaran, or snorkel the surrounding reefs, rife with marine life.</p>
          <p class="titulo" style="margin-bottom: 0.6rem;">SHROUD CAY</p>
          <p class="texto">The Exumas are home to hundreds of cays, but Shroud Cay has earned a reputation as being particularly striking. The small unoccupied island is home to a network of tidal creeks that crisscross the cay, through which small boats may leisurely idle as guests glimpse a variety of tropical fish and crustaceans. The mangrove... estuaries are ideal for paddle boarding, and known for the frequent appearance of sea turtles.</p>

          <p class="texto">People the world over have heard of “Pig Beach,” the uninhabited island in the Bahamas that is home to around twenty pigs and piglets, but few are aware that the island is officially called Big Majors Cay, and is located in the Exuma archipelago. No one knows exactly how the pigs came to reside on the island, but they are known to be... exceptionally friendly, frequently joining visitors in activities like snorkeling and basking on the sand.</p>
          <p class="titulo" style="margin-bottom: 0.6rem;">THUNDERBALL GROTTO</p>
          <p class="texto">The closest island to Big Majors Cay is Staniel Cay, which is home to one of the most stunning sights in the Bahamas. Thunderball Grotto is an immense cavern, accessible only by swimming under a rock ledge at the edge of the cay. Named for the James Bond film in which it’s featured, Thunderball Grotto is home to an assortment of fish and lobster. The grotto can be quite popular, as it’s an exceptional and exhilarating experience for those determined to see it.</p>
          <p class="titulo" style="margin-bottom: 0.6rem;">STINGRAYS AT SHIP CHANNEL CAY</p>
          <p class="texto">Stingrays are a common spectacle in the shallow water surrounding Ship Channel Cay, and despite their namesake, they’re quite friendly. Visitors can feed the rays fish by hand, and easily get close enough to pet them. The stingrays grow up to a few feet in diameter, and they will typically swim right up to the shore. Time with the rays might be limited, however; they tend to vacate the area when Ship Channel Cay’s local nurse sharks arrive.</p>

            <p class="texto">The Exuma island chain is home to some of the world’s best paddle boarding spots. Enthusiasts know that the tranquil turquoise waters are second to none when it comes to leisurely paddling smooth seas.</p>
            <p class="titulo" style="margin-bottom: 0.6rem;">WARDERICK WELLS</p>
            <p class="texto">Warderick Wells is the headquarters of the Exuma Cays Land & Sea Park, chosen for its geographical location near the center of the park. On this cay, you’ll find the Exuma visitor’s center, which is open daily and offers... artifacts, displays, and gifts to those passing through. Near the park’s office sits the impressive sight of a fifty-three foot beached whale skeleton. More than seven miles of nature trails traverse the island from one end to the other for guests interested in a robust hike.</p>
            <p class="titulo" style="margin-bottom: 0.6rem;">ALLAN’S CAY</p>
            <p class="texto">A U-shaped island in the Northern Exumas, Allan’s Cay is home to more than a thousand rock iguanas, a subspecies of the Bahamian rock iguana that is considered to be one of the most endangered lizards on the planet. Though protected by law, the large iguanas welcome visitors bearing gifts of fruit, especially mango. The lizards can grow up to four and a half feet long, making them simultaneously a formidable and impressive sight.</p>

            <p class="texto">Of all the things to see and do in Exuma, these are among the best. The reefs around the Exumas are renowned for their beauty and ease of access, perfect for those that want an up-close and personal look at unique sea life like turtles, rays, and even sharks. Diving for conch and lobster is not only fun but rewarding, depending on when you visit—lobster season runs from August to March. And while some haven’t ever considered eating conch, it’s a tasty and distinct Bahamian delicacy. Several vendors offer deep sea fishing expeditions for marlin, tuna, and the tropical wahoo, and many places on the islands will be happy to cook up your catch of the day.</p>

            <p class="texto">Few can say that they’ve hand-fed a shark, which is what makes Ship Channel Cay an exhilarating opportunity not to be missed. Schools of nurse sharks are accustomed to visitors and frequently swim in the shallows looking for food. Guests can wade in the surf with local “shark wranglers,” who use fish to attract the nurse sharks. Those who want an even more up-close experience can snorkel the nearby reefs, which are populated with nurse sharks, Caribbean reef sharks, and even the occasional bull shark.</p>
